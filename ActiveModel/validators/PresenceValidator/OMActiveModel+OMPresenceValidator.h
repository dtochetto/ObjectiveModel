@interface OMActiveModel (OMPresenceValidator)
/*!
 * @param properties A string property name OR
 * a collection of string property names conforming to NSFastEnumeration.
 *
 * Validates that the specified attributes are not blank (as defined by NSObject+Blank). Example:
 *
 *   @interface Person : OMActiveModel
 *		@property (assign) NSString *firstName;
 *   @end
 *
 *   @interface Person
 *		@synthesize firstName;
 *
 *		+ (void)initialize
 *		{
 *	    	[self validatesPresenceOf:@"firstName" withOptions:nil];
 *		}
 *   @end
 *
 * The firstName property must be defined for the object and it cannot be nil or blank.
 *
 * Configuration options:
 * * <tt>"message"</tt> - A custom error message (default is: "can't be blank").
 * * TODO: <tt>"on"</tt> - Specifies when this validation is active. Runs in all
 *   validation contexts by default (+nil+), other options are <tt>"create"</tt>
 *   and <tt>"update"</tt>.
 * * TODO: <tt>"if"</tt> - Specifies a selector to call to determine if the validation should
 *   occur (e.g. <tt>"if" => @selector(allowValidation)</tt>. The selector should return YES or NO.
 * * TODO: <tt>"unless"</tt> - Specifies a selector to call to determine if the validation should
 *   not occur (e.g. <tt>"unless" => @selector(skipValidation)</tt>. The selector should return YES or NO.
 * * TODO: <tt>"strict"</tt> - YES or NO. Specifies whether the validator should throw a runtime exception
 *	 if the validation fails.
