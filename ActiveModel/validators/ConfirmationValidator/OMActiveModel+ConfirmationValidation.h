@interface OMActiveModel (ConfirmationValidation)



/*!
 * Encapsulates the pattern of wanting to validate a password or email
 * address field with a confirmation.
 *
 *   Model:
 *     class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
 *       validates_confirmation_of :user_name, :password
 *       validates_confirmation_of :email_address,
 *                                 :message => "should match confirmation"
 *     end
 *
 *   View:
 *     <%= password_field "person", "password" %>
 *     <%= password_field "person", "password_confirmation" %>
 *
 * The added +password_confirmation+ attribute is virtual; it exists only
 * as an in-memory attribute for validating the password. To achieve this,
 * the validation adds accessors to the model for the confirmation
 * attribute.
 *
 * NOTE: This check is performed only if +password_confirmation+ is not
 * +nil+. To require confirmation, make sure
 * to add a presence check for the confirmation attribute:
 *
 *   validates_presence_of :password_confirmation, :if => :password_changed?
